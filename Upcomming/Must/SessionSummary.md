### C. Comprehensive Notification Management

*   **Goal**: Implemented a flexible system for multi-channel user notifications.
*   **Status**: **Partially complete.** Core backend and display UI are ready. User preferences UI is the next step.
*   **Key Components**: `NewAssignmentNotification`, `DataExportReadyNotification`, multi-channel delivery, `NotificationBell.vue`, `Notifications/Index.vue`, `NotificationController`, `user_notification_preferences` table/model, `NotificationPreferenceController`.
*   **Documentation**: `NotificationFeaturesSummary.md`, `BoilerplateFeaturesTasks.md` (Tasks for this feature are partially complete).

## 2. Current Status & Next Steps

*   **Last Completed Feature**: Comprehensive Notification Management (backend and display UI are ready).
*   **Next Feature to Implement**: User notification preferences UI.
*   **Current Task**: Build UI for managing notification preferences (e.g., "email me for X, don't email me for Y").

## 3. Pending Debugging

*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Setup**: We encountered an issue where the 2FA setup UI (`Profile/TwoFactorAuthentication.vue`) was not correctly displaying the QR code and recovery codes after enabling 2FA. This was due to the `user` object not being correctly updated in Inertia props. We paused debugging this to move to Notification Management.

## 4. Next Action for User

When you return, please indicate that you have reviewed this `SessionSummary.md` file. We will then proceed with the next task: **Building the UI for managing notification preferences.**

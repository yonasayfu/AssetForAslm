Because the mailparse extension doesn’t exist yet for PHP 8.4 on Windows, you have three practical choices:
                                                                                                                                          
  1. Use a PHP version that does have a mailparse DLL (recommended).                                                                      
     Install PHP 8.3 or 8.2 in parallel, drop the matching php_mailparse.dll into that PHP’s ext folder, enable it in php.ini, then run   
     Mailcatcher/Composer from that PHP build. (Your main AssetManagement app can still use PHP 8.4.)                                     
  2. Switch to an alternative catch-all SMTP tool (no PHP dependency).                                                                    
     Mailpit (https://github.com/axllent/mailpit) is a single binary that provides SMTP + web UI without needing mailparse—it’s what I’d  
     use if you just need a local inbox and don’t want to juggle PHP versions.                                                            
  3. Temporarily ignore the requirement (for quick experiments only).                                                                     
     Run composer install --ignore-platform-req=ext-mailparse. Mail parsing will be disabled, so use this only if you just need a         
     placeholder install and don’t rely on Mailcatcher’s UI.                                                                              

  Given the hassle you’re seeing, option 1 or 2 is the way to go. If you’d rather avoid PHP juggling entirely, Mailpit will let you plug  
  in the same MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1 / MAIL_PORT=1025 settings and capture reset emails immediately.                                         
 
 
 Let’s go with Option 2 (Mailpit) so you can keep PHP 8.4 and still capture password-reset emails.

    Grab the latest Windows mailpit-windows-amd64.zip from https://github.com/axllent/mailpit/releases (choose the regular build, not     
    “portable” unless you prefer it). Unzip it somewhere like C:\tools\Mailpit.                                                           
  - Run Mailpit                                                                                                                           
    Start it from PowerShell:                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                          
    cd C:\tools\Mailpit                                                                                                                   
    .\mailpit.exe --smtp 1025 --http 8025                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                          
    Leave that window open while testing. Mailpit listens for SMTP on port 1025 and serves the web inbox at http://127.0.0.1:8025.

    In your AssetManagement .env, set:

    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null

    MAIL_PASSWORD=null                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                          
    Then clear cached config: php artisan config:clear.                                                                                   
  - Run your reset flow                                                                                                                   
    Trigger “Forgot Password” in the app. The mail should appear instantly in the Mailpit UI at http://127.0.0.1:8025. Click the message  
    to inspect links and confirm the reset works.                                                                                         
  - Clean up PHP warnings (optional)                                                                                                      
    Since Mailcatcher/mailparse aren’t needed anymore, comment out extension=php_mailparse.dll in C:\php\php.ini and restart the shell so 
    the warning disappears.                                                                                                               
  - Next steps (optional)                                                                                                                 
      1. Create a shortcut or Windows Scheduled Task that launches Mailpit so it’s always ready during development.                       
      2. If multiple projects need it, add Mailpit to PATH and use mailpit.exe --config C:\mailpit.toml for a persistent setup.           
                                                                                                                                          
  Once Mailpit is running you can safely ignore the Composer ext-mailparse requirement and focus on testing password resets.

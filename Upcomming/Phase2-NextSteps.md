# Phase 2 – Next Steps & UI Alignment Plan

## Completed
- Staff module now mirrors Geraye screens (metrics row, search toolbar, styled table, copy-consistent toasts).
- Users module delivers CRUD, role/permission assignment, and staff linking with navigation gated by `users.manage`.
- Audit logging in place: activity log migration, reusable Eloquent trait, and ActivityTimeline UI now surface staff/user CRUD, role changes, and staff link updates.

## Remaining
- None (Phase 2 identity scope complete). Ready to move to Phase 3 deliverables.

## Testing Checklist
- Validate staff UI (filters, metrics, CRUD) matches Geraye spacing/typography.
- Ensure role and permission updates reflect immediately in the Inertia payload (nav visibility).
- Confirm audit logs record create/update/delete actions, role/permission changes, and staff link updates with actor names.
- Review Staff/User edit pages to ensure timelines display most recent 20 entries without layout issues.

Update `Phase2-IdentityNotes.md` as additional observations or edge cases arise so Phase 2 documentation stays current.

Perfect question, Yonas ✅ — based on **all the screenshots** you shared (Dashboards, Alerts, Assets, Lists, Reports, Tools, Advanced, Setup, Help/Support, Manage Dashboard, etc.) and the structure we derived from Asset Tiger — here’s exactly what should go inside your `AppSidebar.vue` (menu structure only, no logic or icons yet).

This version groups items in a clean, collapsible way following **Inertia Vue 3 + Tailwind** conventions.

✅ **Next step suggestion:**
If you confirm this sidebar structure, I’ll show you the **`AppSidebar.vue` template** version with:

* dynamic group rendering,
* icons from **Lucide** (e.g., `Home`, `Settings`, `AlertTriangle`, etc.),
* and collapsible state handling using Vue 3 composition API.

Would you like me to generate that next?
